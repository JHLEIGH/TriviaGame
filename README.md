# TriviaGame
Homework #5

This is a simple trivia game about celebrities.  On clicking the start button, 20 questions are displayed each with 4 possible answers.
The player can select only 1 answer per question and has 10 minutes to answer all questions. A timer is diplayed showing the time remaining. Once the 10 minutes are up, the game ends and a message is displayed showing how many questions were answered correctly, how many were answered incorrectly and how many were not answered.

This project is useful as light entertainment for persons who wish to test their knowledge on celebrity trivia, but it can also be helpful to students of web development, as it was for me. As a required assignment in my Web Development Coding course, developing this basic game was a useful exercise in strengthening my understanding of html, css, javascript and jquery. It was also helpful in reinforcing my understanding of how to dynamically build web pages, how to build and manipulate arrays, and how to implement timers.

The prerequisite for embarking on this project is an intermediate understanding of html, css, javascript and jquery. 

Useful resources for me have been W3Schools, stackoverflow and generally google searches, as well as teacher assistants for my course.

This project is maintained by me.
